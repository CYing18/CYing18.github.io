  # I am Rongsheng Wang, I used to study at Macao Polytechnic University (MPU) and work under the supervision of Prof.<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=lLg3WRkAAAAJ">Tao Tan</a>. My research interests are LLM, and MLLMs. I am currently seeking a PhD opportunity. </br></br>I publish a lot of open source projects on <a href="https://github.com/WangRongsheng">ðŸ”—Github</a> <img alt="GitHub User's stars" src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/wangrongsheng?style=flat-square">. I have served as a core developer on projects such as <a href="https://github.com/kaixindelele/ChatPaper/stargazers" target="_blank">ChatPaper<img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/kaixindelele/ChatPaper?color=orange" alt="GitHub Stars"></a>, <a href="https://github.com/WangRongsheng/XrayGLM/stargazers" target="_blank">XrayGLM<img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/WangRongsheng/XrayGLM?color=orange" alt="GitHub Stars"></a>, <a href="https://github.com/WangRongsheng/awesome-LLM-resourses/stargazers" target="_blank">Awesome-LLM-Resources<img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/WangRongsheng/awesome-LLM-resourses?color=orange" alt="GitHub Stars"></a>, and <a href="https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/TinyDeepSeek/stargazers" target="_blank">TinyDeepSeek<img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/FreedomIntelligence/TinyDeepSeek?color=orange" alt="GitHub Stars"></a>. I shared some of the datasets and model weights used by the project at <a href="https://huggingface.co/wangrongsheng">ðŸ”—HuggingFace</a>. I likewise like to post some small-parameter LM at <a href="https://ollama.com/wangrongsheng">ðŸ”—Ollama</a> to help people use it locally.

  I am a second-year Masterâ€™s student in Computer Science at Xiamen University, where I conduct research in medical artificial intelligence under the supervision of Prof.<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Uh1EpKQAAAAJ&hl=en">Rongshan Yu</a> at the Biomedical AI Laboratory. Concurrently, I hold a research internship position at Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, under the mentorship of Dr.<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Z4LgebkAAAAJ&hl=en">Junjun He</a> on Generalist Medical Artificial Intelligence.

  My research focuses on how AI can transform healthcare, with particular interests in 1) Computational Pathology, 2) Multi-omics, and 3) Multimodal Large Language Models. These experiences have reinforced my commitment to pursuing a Ph.D. to further contribute to the development of clinically reliable AI systems. I am actively seeking Ph.D. opportunities for Fall 2026 to continue my work in this area.
