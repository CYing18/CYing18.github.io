short_bio: |
  I am a second-year Master’s student in Computer Science at Xiamen University, where I conduct research in medical artificial intelligence under the supervision of Prof.<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Uh1EpKQAAAAJ&hl=en">Rongshan Yu</a> at the Biomedical AI Laboratory. Concurrently, I hold a research internship position at Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, under the mentorship of Dr.<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Z4LgebkAAAAJ&hl=en">Junjun He</a> on Generalist Medical Artificial Intelligence.

  My research focuses on how AI can transform healthcare, with particular interests in 1) Computational Pathology, 2) Multi-omics, and 3) Multimodal Large Language Models. These experiences have reinforced my commitment to pursuing a Ph.D. to further contribute to the development of clinically reliable AI systems. I am actively seeking Ph.D. opportunities for Fall 2026 to continue my work in this area.
